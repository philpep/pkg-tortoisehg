tortoisehg (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Ludovico Cavedon ]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #557263).
  * Update copyright file.
  * Bump mercurial dependency to 1.4.
  * Specify minimum version for pyobject and pygtk dependencies.
  * Set Python-Version to current.
  * Replace fix-license-path.patch with add-config-file.patch: the whole
    config file needs to be provided.
  * Remove avoid-double-locale-install.patch (merged upstream).
  * Add preserve-version.patch to prevent setup.py from overriding the package
    version (but still fix it by hand after clean, as patches are unapplied
    before calling setup.py).
  * Include html documentation registered with doc-base (and recommend
    libjs-jquery).

  [ Max Bowsher ]
  * Remove obsolete note about repacking from README.source.
  * Drop python from Depends, ${python:Depends} will add it automatically.
  * Depend on mercurial, not mercurial-common.
  * Add Format-Specification line to debian/copyright, and tidy.
  * Change section to 'vcs'.
  * Narrow builddep from python-dev to python.
  * With agreement of maintainer, add myself to Uploaders.
