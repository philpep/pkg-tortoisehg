tortoisehg (2.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The TortoiseHg Nautilus extension (tortoisehg-nautilus) has been removed
  beause it is not comptabile with Gtk+ 3 and there is no interested from
  upstream in porting it to the new library
  (http://groups.google.com/group/thg-dev/msg/8c6b89fd1fd20ac9).
